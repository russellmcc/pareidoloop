pareidoloop
===========

1. generate random polygons
2. feed them into a face detector
3. mutate to increase recognition confidence

difficult stuff (the cv lib) by [liuliu]

idea via roger alsing's [evolution of mona lisa], and greg borenstein's [machine pareidolia]

notes
=====
* try out a [demo]
* currently tested only in chrome (v 21)
* hangs firefox for some reason (on win xp anyway)
* "save images" only works in chrome
* probably a bunch of bugs in there
* have patience - let it churn away for a few hours and see what you get
